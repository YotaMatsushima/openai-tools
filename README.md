# OpenAI Tools

This repository contains a collection of scripts and utilities related to OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The scripts are organized into directories based on their functionality or usage context.

## Directory Structure

- `reddit/`: Contains scripts related to Reddit. See [the README in the reddit directory](reddit/README.md) for more information about the scripts located in this directory.

## Adding New Scripts

To add a new script, please create a new directory for the category (if it does not exist yet), and place the script in that directory. Be sure to add a README file to the directory explaining what the script does and how to use it.

## Current Scripts

- Reddit to Summary (`reddit/reddit2sum.py`): A script that fetches comments from a specified Reddit thread and generates a summary of the discussion using GPT-4. For more information, check out the [README in the reddit directory](reddit/README.md).

## Future Additions

We plan to add more scripts that leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT-4. Stay tuned!
